MovieList Component:

Fetch movie data from an API and distribute it to each MovieBox component.
Implement pagination to control the number of MovieBox components displayed at one time. Consider using a library or write custom logic to handle page changes and data fetching for each page.
Loading Indicators:

Display a spinner or a progress bar when movies are being fetched to inform users that data is loading.
MovieBox Dimensions:

Define a fixed width and height for MovieBox components for a uniform look. Use responsive units like em or rem for flexibility across different screen sizes.
Search Component State:

Maintain the search query in the internal state to manage and submit user input.
MovieBox Props:

Pass movie data, including posters, as props from MovieList to MovieBox. This decouples the MovieBox from data fetching responsibilities and makes it more reusable.
MovieBox Click Event:

Implement an onClick event handler for MovieBox that enlarges the movie poster or opens a modal with more details.
Accessible Labeling:

Use aria-label or a visible <label> element for the search input to guide users effectively, e.g., <input aria-label="Search for movies..." />.
Lazy Loading Posters:

Use lazy loading for movie posters in MovieBox components to improve page load times and performance.
Responsive Design:

Apply media queries in CSS to adapt the layout of MovieList and MovieBox components for different devices.
Error Handling:

Introduce error boundaries around MovieList to catch and handle any errors during API calls or data processing.
Loading Spinner:

Use a spinner component to indicate data is being loaded. Display it centrally over the MovieList component or within each MovieBox until its content is loaded.
Styling Approach:

Employ CSS Modules or styled-components to write CSS that's specific to each component, avoiding style conflicts and enhancing maintainability.
Theming:

Develop a theme with a consistent color palette and
typography to provide a cohesive look across your website. Utilize CSS variables or a theming library to make it easy to maintain and update styles.

Animations:
Add subtle animations for actions like loading new movies or hovering over a MovieBox. Use CSS transitions or animation libraries to enhance visual feedback and user interaction.
When implementing these features, remember to:

Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
Ensure that your code is clean and well-documented.
Test your components both in isolation and as part of the larger application.
Consider accessibility at every step to create an inclusive user experience.
